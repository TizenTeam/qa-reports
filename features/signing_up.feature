  Scenario: Signing up with unique email address
    Given there is no user with email "jamesbond@mi6.co.uk"

    When I sign up as "Timothy Dalton" with email "jamesbond@mi6.co.uk" and password "pussygalore"

    Then I should be on the front page
    And I should see "Sign out" within ".h-navi"
    And there should be a user "Timothy Dalton" with email "jamesbond@mi6.co.uk"

    When I follow "Sign out" within ".h-navi"

    And I should see "Sign In" within ".h-navi"

  Scenario: Signing up without a given name, invalid email and not matching password confirmation
