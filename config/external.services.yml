#
# Configuration for external services to which QA Reports can partially
# integrate using URLs, IDs, and query URIs. Reports may contain links to
# IDs, prepended by prefixes if multiple services are used, in form of
# [[1234]] or [[PREFIX#1234]]. This markup is converted to a link to the
# external service and, depending on the service, additional information
# may be fetched automatically.
#
# Examples of services include e.g. Bugzilla and Gerrit. Currently QA Reports
# provides two handlers for the IDs - 'bugzilla' (fetches also bug related info)
# and 'link' (just a link using defined base URL). Administrator will define
# the URIs etc. in this configuration file.
#
# ONE of the external services here can be defined as a default. It is used
# when more than one service is defined, and when a link without a prefix
# or with an unknown prefix is found.
#
# NOTICE: Prefix must consists of A-Z characters only, and IDs can be
#         numeric only

# Name is shown on the UI to help users decide how to define the ID
